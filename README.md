**<h2>Lung Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)<h2>**<br/>
Overview<br/><br/>
This project is an implementation of a Lung Cancer Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to analyze medical images of lung tissues and classify them as cancerous or non-cancerous based on the presence of abnormalities. It includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction and visualization of results.<br/><br/>

Features<br/>
Data Import: Import DICOM images and associated labels from a specified directory.<br/>
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the imported data by resizing images and organizing them into chunks.<br/>
Model Training: Train a CNN model using the preprocessed data to classify lung tissues as cancerous or non-cancerous.<br/>
Result Visualization: Display model accuracy, generate a confusion matrix, and visualize prediction results through the GUI.<br/><br/>

Requirements<br/>
Python <br/>
TensorFlow<br/>
NumPy<br/>
Pandas<br/>
Matplotlib<br/>
OpenCV<br/>
PyDicom<br/>
Tkinter (for GUI)<br/><br/>
